Library Book Display and Details Page with ReactJS and Library API

Design and implement a library book display application using ReactJS, leveraging a Library API (e.g., Open Library API, Google Books API) to fetch book information. The application should resemble a modern library catalog system. Ensure the following features are included:

1. Book Display: Showcase a grid of book covers on the homepage, fetching data from the Library API.
2. Book Details Page: When a book cover is clicked, redirect to a page displaying detailed information about the book, including its title, author, publication date, summary, and more.
3. Author Information Integration: On the book details page, use the Library API to display a list of books written by the same author.
4. Search Feature: Implement a live search bar on the book page, allowing users to search for books by title, author, or genre.
5. Navigation and Routing: Utilize React Router for navigation between pages and React's useEffect hook for data fetching and component updates.

Grading Criteria:

- Attractiveness and user experience
- Correct implementation of Library API 
- Functionality of search feature and navigation 
- Code quality, structure, and organization
- Adherence to React best practices and hooks usage 

Submission Requirements:

- A working application deployed on a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)
- A GitHub repository containing your codebase
